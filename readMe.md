#Programming
##Program Statement:

The goal of this program is to create a **binary search trees (BST)** and to implement the insert, retrieve, display, remove all matches by location, and remove all. All of these functions should be implemented **recursively**.
##Background: 
Take your [summerActivityLibrary](https://github.com/jiaqiluo/summerActivityLibrary) for planning your summer break and replace the use of a hash table now with a binary search tree, organized by the location. Retrieve and remove by location should retrieve and remove all matches for that location.
##Data Structures: 
Create an **abstract data type using a Binary Search Tree(s)** to store, retrieve (search), display, and remove information stored by location for various activities for this summer. This time we will also get our data sorted when we traverse using inorder traversal!

What does retrieve need to do? It needs to supply back to the calling routine information about the item that matches. Retrieve, since it is an ADT operation, should not correspond with the user (i.e., it should not prompt, echo, input, or output data).
